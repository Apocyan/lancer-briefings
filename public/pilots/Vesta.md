Vesta is strong, hard working, and great in a team situation. While new to the pilot career, they get the job done in a timely and concise manner with an explosive degree of success. Atlas Line born, Vesta grew up around the Toubkal Station with their family before beginning the journey to become a Lancer pilot at the age of 24 with the hopes of creating a better galaxy under Union pillars of ideals. Now 26, they train and fight as a pilot for the thrill of the job as well as to keep their family comfortable and taken care of back home. If you need something blown up or set ablaze, this is the Lancer pilot for you. [Recent update!] Now with a Genghis frame, Vesta’s damage and effectiveness in battle continues to grow with the help of Alter Fires’ signature Flamethrower!
