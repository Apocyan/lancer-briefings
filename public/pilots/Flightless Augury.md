Not too much is known about this pilot's personal life, as he popped up within the Lancer scene mid 30’s with the Everest frame “You Mech Me Happy”. Teal and gray, sharp edges everywhere and drones that swoop in when they’re least expected! Rumor says that he ran into a group of terrorists invading one of the well known cities and the council had given him the legendary frame as a way of saying “Thank you so much! We would have been absolutely lost without you!” He refused of course (as is principal), but upon insisting he accepted the frame and continued to make a name for himself, a man with his own moral code, he doesn’t look at how much a job costs monetarily, but more of what it costs (and effects) morally. A Real life crusader!
