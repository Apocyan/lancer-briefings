# Mission // #003
## Handshakes and Surveys
# Goals
- Get to know your way around the Myrmidon, and your new life with MSMC.
- On arrival to Cadus O1, Recon for Corporate interference, particularly notes of interaction with Cataclysm or Monarch Mazao.
  - Find their contact with the O1 Underground Turf, bag them for further interrogation.

# Stakes
- Cadus O1 is a hotbed with mercenary forces ousted from Pitov, Pi and the OUT Gangs; corporate parties want to light a turf war and destabilize the planet for means unknown.
- At this time, it is believed we have three months before Union Monitoring Forces will move out of orbit.

# Reserves
- None at this time.
- Find some. This shit can and will get messy.
