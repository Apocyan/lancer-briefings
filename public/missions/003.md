# Mission // #005
## THRIVE FOR US
# Goals
- Establish a new faction in the Long Rim. 
    - Establish yourselves in Cumulonimbus and its surrounding "Sphere of Influence".
- Build up strength, enterprises, connections, and wealth in the next five years. 
# Stakes
- In five years, it's predicted that an unprecedented number of highly armed mercenaries, pirates, and military factions will arrive in the Long Rim. UIB intel suggests that these forces are being accumulated by major houses of the Karrakin Trade Baronies, as well as subsidiaries of Harrison Armory. If the bulk of this force makes it, their presence will not only completely destabilize the Rim, but likely lead to full blown war on the Dawnline Shore.

# Reserves
- This section will be updated regularly with notable Reserves.
- A Faction with a "Humanitarian" goal has been established. +2 Efficiency.
