# Mission // #004
## SURVIVE AND EXTRACT
# Goals
- **Survive** contact with Cadus Calling Gang, Monarch Mazao, Pirates, and Aunic Crusaders
- If possible, **extract** whatever it is the CCG are retrieving from the crust of Cadus 01.
# Stakes
- Union is GONE. We are the de facto remaining authority *mostly* adherent to Union's Utopian Pillars. If we fail to remind our opponents of that, Cadus 01's future may stray far from the utopia it hopes for.

# Reserves
- None.
- Notice: MSMC Legal would like to remind you to finish filling out your last wills and testaments.
- Notice: MSMC Head of Medical, **ASCLEPIUS**, has left you one pending message:
- "Seriously, no next of kin? If you're trying to keep secrets, it's going to be much easier when you're both corpses. I recommend penning down *someone*. Legal, and by extension, all of MSMC, couldn't care less to find out who any of you are."
