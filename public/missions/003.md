# Mission // #003
## Handshakes and Surveys
# Goals
- On arrival to Cadus O1, Recon for Corpro-interference, particularly notes of interaction with Cataclysm or Monarch Mazao.
  - Find the corpro-power contacts. One of them needs to squeal about what they're doing in the Pulse Corridor.
# Stakes
- Cadus O1 is a hotbed with mercenary forces ousted from Pitov, Pi and the OUT Gangs; corporate parties want to light a turf war and destabilize the planet for means unknown.
- Union Monitoring Forces are leaving soon. When they do, things are going to get HOT.

# Reserves
- None at this time.
- Find some. This shit is going to get *messy*.
