# Mission // #003
## Handshakes and Surveys
# Goals
- On arrival to Cadus O1, Recon for Corpro-interference, particularly notes of interaction with Cataclysm or Monarch Mazao.
  - Establish yourselves with either the O2 Resurrection Government or the O1 Underground Turf, and probe their ranks for ties with either corpro-power.
    - Find their contact and bag them for further interrogation. 

# Stakes
- Cadus O1 is a hotbed with mercenary forces ousted from Pitov, Pi and the OUT Gangs; corporate parties want to light a turf war and destabilize the planet for means unknown.
- At this time, it is believed we have three months before Union Monitoring Forces will move out of orbit.

# Reserves
- None at this time.
- Find some. This shit can and will get messy.
