# MSMC Myrmidon // 8.22.5016u
On the bridge, **ZEUS** oversees the legion of Horae under his command; at a word, they will turn this vessel into the Cerro-Gordo Blink Gate, and head for the Karakoram Line. For now, the command deck oversees the planet of Pitov-Pi. Fifty-seven million people living lives down there, now all at once shaken by the work of a handful of mercenaries and a district-wide flashdrive. **ZEUS** summons his **MUSES**, the NHPs aboard the vessel, to give him the data spread one more time. As the leading presence of the MSMC here, he can't help but feel that they're ~missing out on a bigger score~ missing an important detail here. The **MUSES** are plain with their scrying: Harrison Armory, Smith-Shimano Corpro, IPS-Northstar, and now the wild card, HORUS, have all shown their hands on this planet. While HORUS will always seek the grandest chaos, the presence of the other three players raises more questions than answers. The problem with all of this? MSMC is here to fight, not investigate. As is, their intel has been stretched to the limits, and now all major players are putting up smokescreens and withdrawing to their respective shadows.

Cadus 01 is the best play here: Plenty of action, loot, and conquest.

With that cleared up, **ZEUS** sends his **MUSES** to their routine cycles. Looking to the command deck, the order is given, the gate is thrown open. Come the hell of **HADES** or the high waters of **POSEIDON**, **ZEUS** intends to strike this anvil *first*.

# MSMC Myrmidon, Orbiting Over CADUS O1 // 2.23.5017u
Across the entirey of Myrmidon, the all-comm crackles to life, with the collected voice of **HERMES** calling out to all souls aboard:

"All hands, all hands. Sunrise! Beautiful starlight rays cascading gently upon potmarked beauty Cadus O1; temperatures in atmoshpere are a nice twenty=nine celsius. Balmy beaches, low transit traffic, and booked rooms at Parabellum resorts await our operatives heading down today." **HERMES** shifts in their seat, reaching over to flick on the music feeds. "Luck of the draw gives **ARES** the DJ set for today. From us to you, wishing a smooth orbit and even smoother tunes, it's *Jupiter Jazz* for today." The beat of pulsing rhythm begins to feed into the ship, and **HERMES** cuts all-comm to let the sounds do their magic. 

Meanwhile, on the LANCER deck, **HOPLITE** finishes prepping the first away team. **MUSE** forecast read the upper atmosphere on arrival, and found the orbit littered with omens. Thousands of ships were already loitering in space, and the few stations propped up by the local government were already inundated with mercenaries. There was no way MSMC could do this the usual way, asserting their status as the de-facto power. Instead, the *Myrmidon* would have to lurk above, while MSMC agents joined the mercenary powderkeg below, to try and secure their objectives in secrecy. 

The only reassurance on violence not spilling out on the streets was the presence of **UNION**; the capital-class *Surtr* casting its shadow over a portion of Cadus O1's ruins. The supervising teacher, the observant parent, keeping its myriad sensors pointed at the surface. 

Waiting. Watching. Ready, ever and always. Nobody, not even HORUS, not even an unshackled NHP mid-cascade, would dare wreak *too much* havoc in this moment.

That is, until the ship departs in three months.
