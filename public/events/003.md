# MSMC Myrmidon // 2.23.5017u
Across the entirey of Myrmidon, the all-comm crackles to life, with the collected voice of **HERMES** calling out to all souls aboard:

"All hands, all hands. Sunrise! Beautiful starlight rays cascading gently upon potmarked beauty Cadus O1; temperatures in atmoshpere are a nice twenty=nine celsius. Balmy beaches, low transit traffic, and booked rooms at Parabellum resorts await our operatives heading down today." **HERMES** shifts in their seat, reaching over to flick on the music feeds. "Luck of the draw gives **ARES** the DJ set for today. From us to you, wishing a smooth orbit and even smoother tunes, it's *Jupiter Jazz* for today." The beat of pulsing rhythm begins to feed into the ship, and **HERMES** cuts all-comm to let the sounds do their magic. 

Meanwhile, on the LANCER deck, **HOPLITE** finishes prepping the first away team. **MUSE** forecast read the upper atmosphere on arrival, and found the orbit littered with omens. Thousands of ships were already loitering in space, and the few stations propped up by the local government were already inundated with mercenaries. There was no way MSMC could do this the usual way, asserting their status as the de-facto power. Instead, the *Myrmidon* would have to lurk above, while MSMC agents joined the mercenary powderkeg below, to try and secure their objectives in secrecy. 

The only reassurance on violence not spilling out on the streets was the presence of **UNION**; the capital-class *Surtr* casting its shadow over a portion of Cadus O1's ruins. The supervising teacher, the observant parent, keeping its myriad sensors pointed at the surface. 

Waiting. Watching. Ready, ever and always. Nobody, not even HORUS, not even an unshackled NHP mid-cascade, would dare wreak *too much* havoc in this moment.

That is, until the ship departs in three months.

# CADUS O1, Underground Warehouse District // 2.23.5017u
Amid the dripping of spent sprinklers, several members of the Cadus Calling Gang stand in puddles of murky water; fallen towers of containers lay in disarray around them, soaking in the stench of waterlogged rations. **MAJOR** walks the perimeter, hands clasped behind his back. He takes in the destruction, while his subordinates calculate the costs. A crowd outside sits on the curbs and street corners, drinking, smoking, and showing little pity for the loss the Gang has taken. 

"Do we have a suspect?" **MAJOR** doesn't look at the gathered personnel; they would wilt under his glare if he turned on them, and that wouldn't cool the rage in his mind. He didn't need to discipline them. His words were left hanging in the air, and there was a tense silence, where none of them dared take responsibility for what must have been a lackluster answer. A private got the shortest stick, and gave the report while his immediate superiors pretended to survey the broken warehouse again.

"Negative. We rooted through our turf, but it doesn't look like they were a local. No petty gangs taking the blame, no family members giving up hideaways. Just a lot of folk pissed off from all our knocking." 

"I see. Do we have details on their appearance?"

"No sir. They were wearing a camo cloth for most of our engagement. They were a walking paint smear, if you get my meaning."

"I do. So, we've nothing to go off of?"

"Nothing really. They didn't take anything, we don't think. They might've hid in the, uh, office for a bit, but that place was mostly cleaned out when we took over."

"I want a copy of the manifest. I want this place cleaned out. Then we pack up, and we pretend it didn't happen. The boys are pissed as is, I had to take them off surface R&R for this. They're not going to want to hear that some rogue asshole jumped a fence and ruined one of our stockpiles on their own."

**MAJOR** sent his detachment away to do as he said. Already, plans were forming in his head, and they weren't ones he needed to share with the rank and file.
