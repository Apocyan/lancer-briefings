Inside Lancer Repair Bay-01, aboard the GMS-AMAZON class Line Carrier *MSMC Myrmidon*, two Lancers hug each other, tightly.

One of them cries. The other holds tighter to their pinky promise.

**HOPLITE** doesn't interrupt. A few broken ribs shift uncomfortably. 

The drinking will help ease their pains.

"--and that is why, with the considerations made by this court, the jury finds the defendant guilty on all counts, and agrees with a sentencing of a six month No-Fly probation."

The assembled mercenaries slowly drift from their comrade's side. The light has gone from his face, despite how closely pressed he stays against the singular bay window of the bar. A freighter, *his* ticket out of here, drifting past with a new Mirrorsmoke replacement instead. Someone in the corner orders a J.C.H. for the poor bastard; in the distance, the lilting tunes of 'Old World' Blues from a portable radio.

MSMC Captain **MEDEA** measures out a budget for the newest addition to the damned. "Why ought I care about these two?"

**HOPLITE** flickers on the screen. They're wearing a light hardsuit, *practically nude* for someone like him. "Because," another transaction comes through; **MEDEA** can't help but curl her lips into a smirk, "they remind me of *us*."

"*Us* us?"

"*No*." Another transaction. More than enough to buy a better ship. "The *Us* that everybody else remembers."

# Cumulonimbus // 8.17.5017u
At the bar, Patrick “Patty-Cake” Ortiz thumbs his last cigarette and thinks about how long it's been since he went to bed before midnight. It’s been three and a half weeks. His VIP is bound to show any moment now. He’s been coming to the bar and waiting for five days straight now. Nothing. 

He and the bartender banter. They entertain ideas of sex, between themselves, each other, the VIP. The bartender thinks she’s not coming tonight. No, she’s definitely coming tonight. If he walks out the front, she’ll be there waiting to drag him in. 

"I clock out in three minutes. If you want, reckon I can take you in the back-way. Might be a tight squeeze."

“Oh, I *bet* you’d like that.”

“...*Or* I could leave you here, and tell my replacement to deafen her hearing aids before you order.”

Patrick hissed through clenched teeth, like he'd scraped himself. "Force of habit when I come here. I'm sorry. Although, *honestly," he leans in, far enough that his breath can be felt: Hot, tinted with the perfume of floral liquor. "I'd offer it up for you, just to get away from **HER**."

Their plan, however, went as quickly as it came.

“Paaaaaatty Caaaaake~!” 

He and the bartender share a *Look*. Patrick's eyes show the his resignation to his fate. The bartender stays, mercifully to pour the drinks. The VIP has an entourage; a dozen new faces to the House, so they can watch Patrick suffer. 

Why like this? The bartender’s pity seemed to ask. Patrick knew why. When he lay in her bed, breathless from their first time. Waiting for her to reciprocate. He was a dumb, horny victim. He said he wasn’t special, he said he went unnoticed. 

Stupid, stupid.

“Then I’ll make sure everyone notices you!” She said it with such glee. He thought they’d have been there to take him after she got hers. But she was a narcissist, a selfish one that couldn’t stand not being the object of desires. She was the devil. She still is, but she definitely *was* too.

Was he dumb now? No, he knew the trick to a Virgin Destroyer: You didn’t spin in your seat, you didn’t rotate the cup in your hands. No, you just slammed it; you let it spill down your chin and soak your collar. You let it perfume your skin and burn love into your flesh.

Was he a victim? A victim had no choice. He did, and at any time he could’ve gone to his boss in the **TEN** and said “no more.” But here he was, lips stinging with tequila, willingly signaling for a second Virgin Destroyer. 

And after a third V.D., the last question didn't even need to be asked.
