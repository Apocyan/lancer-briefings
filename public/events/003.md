# CADUS 01, MSMC Myrmidon  // 3.01.5017u
"How many years have I been here?" **HOPLITE** wondered aloud, softly. Not somberly, not sadly, merely soft, amid the gentle hum of the Muses' routine cycle pattern. It felt like a year, in essence. In practice? Twenty-five years, or so. Their gut feeling told them they'd been promoted one year ago, and before that, their entire life had been in chassis, or a frame, and always in a firefight. Maybe they needed to get their gut checked.

From the observation deck, Cadus O1 was a pockmarked former beauty; much of it swallowed by craters and dust, but the twinkle of its former glory shined in its biodomes. Above her, the atmosphere teemed with a sea of people who never knew what the resort world once looked like on a full moon. Instead, they barely heeded the planet itself, flitting from pole to pole with their goods and services, intent on feeding the ever marching stream passing from blink gate to blink gate. Some were here to feed *on* this march too, and did so with frenzied speed so as to avoid the wrath of the god watching them. The Union Capital Ship *Freyr* did little more than loom menacingly, and the common onlooker would pronounce this as a reason for moving away from Union's grasp.

**HOPLITE** saw what they didn't. They saw the ships that suffered the blows of piracy, drifting wounded in the void, being scooped into the gentle hands of loving souls. Trauma teams and expert repair squadrons, rushing to the scene of a crime seconds old and nursing the victims to health once more, free of any charge. "Like a mother watching her kids at a park. She doesn't shout at them to slow down, but she's always there when they get hurt." **HOPLITE** could tell by the way **ZEUS** shifted their weight, leaning just *so* against the railing alongside them, that they agreed to the observation.

Inside the captain's visor, **HOPLITE** could see endless calculations and simulations playing out. The most basic of these played on the surface, alighting their bodies conversing, the progress of the NHP cycle, and the time before the next shift change. Beyond that, and deeper into its inky depths, **HOPLITE** thought they could see the answer to their question; the day they'd arrived on the ship, dejected in their defeat but eager to prove they were more than a prisoner of war. It didn't do well to dwell on these observations. There was little doubt that **ZEUS** must have been part blinkspace at this point, with how often they'd commanded this ship through the gates. It was as if the captain was living an omni-present life; many other captains relied heavily on their onboard NHPs to command such staggering ships, but for **ZEUS**, they never sought out the advice of their Muses. They would listen when counsel was given, but that was rare, on the grander scale of objectives and missions. 

**ZEUS** proved their own ability as they waited fore Union to eventually depart. Day in and day out, **ZEUS** commanded a thousand different ships, all illusions hiding the presence of a true MSMC vessel in orbit. Holographs, edited data packets, false docking reports, even clever maneuvering behind the hull of the *Freyr*, all to blend into the blink gate traffic. The few who did see these moment behind the curtain, *didn't*. MSMC Legal's *See No Evil* compliance packages were more than enough to convince water frigates on the way to the Long Rim that there was never anything interesting to see out the righthand portholes. 

It was a near endless feat of tactical brilliance. **HOPLITE** turned to make their exit, excusing their departure. One more glimpse into the visor: They saw a fuel depot being littered with burning frames. The coming consequences of these actions. Ripples in space, lapping over the wastes of Cadus O1. They saw the moment they'd begun this exchange with **ZEUS**, and the perfectly timed moment **HOPLITE** turned away to depart.

But something compelled them to turn back, and look once more. **ZEUS** was staring at them. The stare said, "Good work today."

It said other things too, but **HOPLITE** would only hear those in their dreams tonight.
