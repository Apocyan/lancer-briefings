"Are they broken?" **ANUBIS** had found a moment to duck out from the hustle of the early afternoon. In the distance, she could still hear the television, reporting on the site of the pirate attack. It wasn't enough to deter the mission, it seemed.

"They can't break." **HOPLITE** replied.

"That far though, seriously?" **HERACLES** was in the middle of putting on his hardsuit when they'd gotten the private transmission; coupling belts hugged his waist, half-pressurized and forgotten about. "They'll be gone for *years*."

"They've calculated for that."

"I guess it makes sense," **SET** was alone, he'd assured the team; they believed him, given their small exposure to the seemingly paracausal bowels of Parabellum. "It's called the **CORRIDOR**. All corridors end somewhere."

"And they're gonna, what, hold the door for us?" The cynicism was ripe from **CADMUS**. They never liked MSMC plans that weren't as straightforward as *SEE, SHOOT, LEAVE*. 

"They'll *be* the door." **HOPLITE** settled any further concerns with their tone. This wasn't a discussion, just a reminder for what was coming next.

The feed cuts; **HERACLES** opens a private group chat seconds later.
