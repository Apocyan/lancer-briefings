# CADUS 01, MSMC Myrmidon - Bomber Wing HARPY // 3.03.5017u
//[HARPY]:: DISREGARD LAST TARGET, AFFIRM. STANDING BY NEW TARGET.

//[AEOLUS]:: WINDS STEADY. NEW TARGET. ENGAGEMENT PARAMETERS TRANSMIT.

//[HARPY]:: NEW TARGET, AFFIRM. ENGAGEMENT RECEIVED. GREEN LIGHT.

//[AEOLUS]:: GREEN LIGHT, AFFIRM.

. . .

//[HARPY]:: GOOD HIT, GOOD HIT. TARGET 268 OF 3677 CONFIRM OUT OF ACTION.

//[AEOLUS]:: THEIA CONFIRMS TARGET 268 OUT OF ACTION. STANDBY NEW TARGET.

//[HARPY]:: STANDBY NEW TARGET, AFFIRM.

# CADUS 01, MSMC Myrmidon - Main Loading Bay // 3.03.5017u

//[SISYPHUS]:: THREE UNITS NOW OUT OF ACTION. TWELVE STILL STAND.

//[ASCLEPIUS]:: They're out of our radar, which must mean they've fallen out. I'm making an official recommendation to pull out now--

//[SISYPHUS]:: NEGATIVE. THE INCLINE IS IN OUR FAVOR. DAMAGE IS NEGLIGIBLE.

//[ASCLEPIUS]:: --I'll record your opinions, but as the Head of Medicine on this ship, I'm going to disregard them. 

//[ASCLEPIUS]:: I'm watching burning hulls scream down ninety degree angled docking bays. I'm watching our dropships get zapped out of the sky like gnats near a lightning rod.

//[ASCLEPIUS]:: The deck below me is on fire. The deck above just disintegrated at its designated fail-points. 

//[ASCLEPIUS]:: Official diagnosis: We have approximately fourty minutes to spare, and not nearly enough hazard pay to cover this.

# CADUS 01, Monarch Mazao Gaia - Ancillary Power Junction Echo-4 // 3.03.5017u

//[TOXOTAI]:: Stupid, stupid, stupid--

//[PHALANX]:: Cut the excess chatter!

//[TOXOTAI]:: --can't believe they didn't think we'd board them--

//[PELTAST]:: Which superheavy is the objective?!

//[PELTAST]:: Scratch that, we're following the new Lancer inserts.

//[TOXOTAI]:: --these fucking morons are running at us with *swords*!

//[PHALANX]:: CUT THE CHATTER!

//[HOPLITE]:: Seconded, cut unnecessary comms. 

//[HOPLITE]:: Infantry, Lancers will lead the way. Stay close. We're taking the superheavy.

//[TOXOTAI]:: Oh Gods, I haven't had this high of a streak since Calvary in '11!

# CADUS 01, MSMC Myrmidon - Bridge // 3.03.5017u

//[MUSES]:: **DIVE**.

The ship lurches into free fall. A dozen navigators project course corrections, redirecting a vessel of burning alloys, superheated Barbarossa railguns, and giddily trigger-fingering, morally gray mercenaries through a staccato profile of superheavy 3x3 Block Short-Spool Cannons. 

Their calculations are nearly perfect. Thanks to this, only seventeen crewmembers aboard deck Kilo, section 772, die to a kinetic round obliterating their surroundings in an instant.

//[MUSES]:: **BROADSIDE**.

The ship tilts at an absurd degree. On the main loading deck, twelve Barbarossa frames rely on their magnetized frames to keep from descending into a fast free fall. Twelve Apocalypse Rails fire a blinding volley and connect with the third auxiliary Dragoon Mess Hall aboard the Monarch Mazao Gaia, punching through layers of nano-reinforced shipweave, circuitry, coolant pipes, seventy-seven emergency triage patients, and countless more subsystems of humanity before expelling radioactively white-hot heat into the exit wound target known to the crew of the Gaia as hydro-containment tankard 033; flash boiling its metric tons of contents into steam, which violently burst tankard 033, further wounding fourty-six Karrakin Trade engineering apprentices taking shelter there.

//[MUSES]:: **FLEE**.

The bridge seizes up for a moment, breaths caught in their throats as the ship-core NHP casts its dire omen once more.

//[ZEUS]:: "**BELAY THAT PREDICTION.**"

The bridge breathes once more. The **MUSES** obey their captain. The crew renew their faith in their mission.

# CADUS 01, In Orbit //3.03.5017u
Two captains of two Creighton-Class Frigates whistle a fine tune together. One of them pours the other another drink; the artificial lighting has been dimmed to appreciate the immense beauty of the night, on the perpetually dark side of Cadus 01. 

Soon, they say to each other, things will sort themselves out on the other side.

Soon, but not yet.

So why not have another drink?
