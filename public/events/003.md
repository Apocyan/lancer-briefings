# Cumulonimbus - Dockside Cirrus // 8.25.5017u
"Dawn Ryder, we're picking up your transmitter now. Bay 212 designated for your landing. Say again, Bay 212, go for your landing." Lefty wiped the sleep from his eyes, giving his console another few resounding taps with his fingers; the thing was always a piece of shit, the terminal everyone dumped on the latest arrival, and it'd been acting up all of this day cycle, clocking in constant early arrivals with flight log discrepancies all over the place. 

"Piece of crap," he said to nobody in particular, trying to ignore how cool and collected the responders for the big haul freighters sounded while they conveyed traffic above him; somebody crawled past on the ceiling, drifting from their seat in the zero-g chamber to a nearby holo-projection of the dockside. Maybe he just needed to unhook after this one, snag an instant-coffee, rehydrate a protein-pack, and hit the pod for an early night-cycle. He could catch up on pankrati videos, and snack on chocolate crickets, and for once not feel the residual sting of the old terminal's glow against his retinas. 

He flicked a switch, which clicked with a thick, perfunctory sensation, and the terminal whirred with a semi-gigabyte rate data filter. *Sonuvabitch*. The ship didn't ping any prior manifests, meaning they were *new*. That meant a full search, a *real* search, a transition to artificial gravity just to bang around inside their shitty storage tank and fine them for smuggling Buddha knows what inside-- Unless...

Another flicked switch, punched twice thereafter for a click as its inner mechanism began to stick like old glue.

# Cumulonimbus - "Stratus" Bay // 8.25.5017u
"Kapkat." Chips clink in response. Somebody swears in Sparri, and the background sounds of grunting from the broadcasted Skol Meya game grow louder. 

"We hungry yet?" Someone scoots their chair back, heading towards a kettle burbling with anticipation. The gyro-stabilizers on the burner lilt with the gradual shift of the canal-ship through a gravity upswell. 

"I could eat," the winner remarks, prompting half-joking sneers from the other players; their tattoos blend with the gliss afterglow, like snakes dancing in the mirror. 

Chipped china bowls are set. The Skol Meya game reaches a satisfying conclusion, based off the amicable remarks from the players and viewers alike. Kelp noodles are draped neatly over a miso broth, and **Patrick** is allowed to pluck the best best krait rangoon for winning the last pot of the night.

They eat in silence, save for the slurping of noodles, the muted cheers of a background television, and the hushed chime of a permitted docking request. 

# Cumulonimbus - House of Cats // 8.25.5017u
Another Harrison Armory representative walks off with her winnings, and two new partners for the night-cycle draped on either arm. **Merlot** smiles that tight, polite smile one has to make when they aren't wearing a mask, and pretends they hadn't greeted those two just hours earlier, as timid, love-hungry kuirasser trainees for a new House of Stone shipment. It's not their place, after all, and really, those poor boys would've abused the gift **Merlot** would've given them-- That is, a chance to be granted a *Wish*. The thought reinvokes a genuine grin, and they stalk their way through the more licentious, archeo-grecian architecture of their wing in the House of Cats, eager to happen upon the love-drunks and the doe-eyed, the tender and vulnerable prey of new arrivals aching to rub skin with the myriad Baronic and Armory powers that can be found in these sauna-chambers. 

Their night-cycle, destined for more intrigue than pleasure, motivates them in tandem with the deliciously fat cut **VECTOR INTERSTELLAR** pays out in the day-cycle. With this many rivals sharing the House this year, things are bound to grow hotter. **Merlot** wouldn't miss it for the world.
