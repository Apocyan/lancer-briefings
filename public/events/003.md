VANTA: ...And that ought to conclude anything of serious note. Long story short, we're tying up loose ends and opening for the summer crowds. Questions?
UMBRA: You know we're the only two to ever chat here, right?
VANTA: Great question.
UMBRA: I just don't really see the poi--
VANTA: I don't *know* that, actually, since it clearly shows we have two other members of our *elite* team here, warranting a need for these briefings.
VANTA: Isn't that right, you two?
. . .
UMBRA: Hold on, let me just--

UMBRA: --There we go.
VANTA: Questions, Void?
VOID: ┐( ˘_˘)┌
UMBRA: Figures.
VANTA: Can you do the same for--
UMBRA: No. He'd just think the meeting was over.
VANTA: ... *Well.* If we don't have anything else to address, then I'll say this meeting *is* ov--
VOID: (◯Δ ◯ ∥)
>//USER "VOID" HAS EMBEDDED A LINK INTO THE CHAT: "STATION EXTERIOR CAMERA AFT-44"
UMBRA: Holy *shit*. Is that one of ours?
VANTA: No. That **GENGHIS** doesn't register on any of my logs.
VOID: (┛◉Д◉)┛彡┻━┻
VANTA: Who's on standby? **SANDEEP** and his **PUPPY** need to get on this shit ASAP--
MIDNIGHT: *MINE.*

 # Cumulonimbus - Somewhere in the Mists // 8.27.5017u
 **HARUSPEX** gently set the cup of noodles next to the monitors. Steam wafted from the top, fogging the screens with a light condensation, lending about the only warmth the pirate crew could afford to their setup. Outside, blankets of thick mist swaddled them away, nestling them amid the endless corridors of old Volador tech; it just so happened to make their hideout damned cold. The Communications Lead did his best to warm his hands overtop the bobbing vegetables and synth-meat, while plugging into their local comms link. The clunky monitors stirred to life, green and orange hex-code flickering beneath the fogged glass. The low, consistent tone of some forgotten notification hummed in the background.

 "Check in."

 "**ORACLE**, manifest editing."

 "**ASTROMANCER**, last tests for the new gyro-stabilizers. What happened to the replacements we were due?"

 Union had got them, but **HARUSPEX** didn't feel like the news was worth breaking. *They're coming* remained the official statement on that. It made it easier to ignore the crippled budget reports. At this rate, they'd get folded into a bigger crew by the end of the year.

 "They're coming. Next."

 "**WISHBONE**, lunch."

 "**SCRY**, replacement for **AUGUR**. Still figuring out how this comm stuff works..."

 *Great*, **HARUSPEX** thought, *I'll get to play beginner's tech support for the rest of this cycle.* The noodles were still hot, but it was easier to scarf them down now instead of trying to talk with their mouth full. Under the haze of the monitors, a singular comms channel blinked with a red hue. It was only as they were halfway through the cup that the CL realized a red hue meant a *lost contact*. 

 **TAROT**. 

 That's when the CL realized what that low tone really was: **TAROT**'s flatlined biometrics.

 "*FUCK!*" Hot noodles spilled over the keyboard as they drew up the nearest video feed; their fingers stung with the burn of broth as they watched **TAROT** get cut in half by a Lancer. Immediately, they thumbed the button labeled "ALL COMMS", and hooked their systems into the station's main intranet lines. Their helmet, a multipaneled visor designed like the eyes of a spider, illuminated with the siphoned power, its projections immediately syncing up to the remaining few dozen biometric tags in their crew.

 "OBSIDIAN! GODDAMIT, OBSIDIAN!"

 "Glass?" A challenge response, asked by a mercenary who, undoubtedly, would rather be having his lunch than dealing with a training exercise in a dying pirate crew.

 "NEGATIVE. OBSIDIAN! Scramble what we have out of cold storage, all of it. Fucking **NOCTILUCENT** found us!"

 All biometric tags read an increased heart-rate from those words. Well, most of them. **HARUSPEX** deleted **TAROT** and his team from the list.

 "AND SOMEBODY BRING THAT FUCKING SHIP DOWN."
