# CADUS 01, MSMC Myrmidon  // 3.03.5017u
For once, many residents of Cadus 01 could say that their recovering resort world was positively *pleasant*. The artifical weather spelled out a placid forecast for the foreseeable future; the similarly manufactured currents of their beaches washing out the din of traffic and tourism with its routine tides. In the commercial district, which swallowed up much of the city, nary a sound of disgruntled patrons nor unruly spacers could be found, and instead came the coaxing songs of karaoke bars and cafe espresso machines. 

In some forlorn corner of Parabellum, a shrine of modest yet monolithic size holds the orbit of a dedicate troup; Aunic crests emblazoned with faithful pride on their chassis, these devotees tending meticulously to its cleaning and care. Few residents bother to stop and stare at this point, deterred in equal parts by a veritable fumigation of incense smoke, and the offputting arsenals that bristle from the motley assemblage of frames they've parked nearby. Still, the streets are undoubtedly well kept, and there is a certain reassuring melody to their chants.

Below, streets are being *cleaned*, to the point of discomfort. The CCG froths and thrashes, tearing apart their own turf, searching for Lancers that are no longer there. Down below, the residents of Cadus 01 recognize that things are about to become much more *unpleasant*. 

In orbit, Union lets out a collective sigh.

In orbit, the *MSMC Myrmidon* is running out of places to hide. 

Each and every twenty-four hour period (sometimes sooner, sometimes later) the ship must duck, weave, and reinvent itself. In a week, it could be a water transport drifting towards the Rim, or an SSC pleasure barge that has made the unfortunate discovery about Cadus 01's current status as a "Resort Planet". More and more, the **MUSES**, the onboard NHP of the ship, have been telling them to hide behind Union's vessel; like the curtains for a performance's scene change. With Union departing, the **MUSES** cast foreboding prophecies for the immediate future. 

Their predictions for the conflict below, even more dire. 

**HOPLITE** puts in a couple of calls. 

Somewhere on the pockmarked surface of Cadus 01, a ship that *doesn't exist on paper* drops off a package that *doesn't contain anything.*

Somewhere in the upper atmosphere, an SSC representative tells the customs officer they're merely *passing through*. Then they order another drink at the lounge. 

"One step at a time," the Union officer remarks. It tastes bitter.
